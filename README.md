```

Each hack:
1. Shows a dramatic jumpscare intro
2. Applies the chaos effect
3. Stores a flag in localStorage (expires after 24 hours by default)

---

## Configuration

Each hack has a `CONFIG` object at the top of the file that you can customize:

```js
const CONFIG = {
  showIntro: true,                      // Set to false to skip the intro overlay
  introDelay: 3000,                     // How long to show intro (in milliseconds)
  storageDuration: 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000  // How long before hack can trigger again (default: 24 hours)
};
```

### Options

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| `showIntro` | boolean | `true` | Show the dramatic intro overlay. Set to `false` to skip straight to the effect. |
| `introDelay` | number | varies | How long the intro displays before the effect starts (in milliseconds). |
| `storageDuration` | number | 24 hours | How long until the hack can trigger again for the same user. Set to `0` for every page load. |

### Examples

**Skip the intro entirely:**
```js
const CONFIG = {
  showIntro: false,
  introDelay: 3000,
  storageDuration: 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000
};
```

**Trigger on every page load (no cooldown):**
```js
const CONFIG = {
  showIntro: true,
  introDelay: 3000,
  storageDuration: 0
};
```

**Longer cooldown (1 week):**
```js
const CONFIG = {
  showIntro: true,
  introDelay: 3000,
  storageDuration: 7 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000
};
```
